This directory contains transparency masters (which may also be used asstudy guides) for the book "Data Structures and Program Design in C++"by Robert L. Kruse and Alexander J. Ryba, copyright (C) 1999 byPrentice-Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458.  All rightsreserved.  Instructors who have adopted the above book as a required textbookare hereby given permission to make transparencies for use in lectures fromthese files.  Any other reproduction or distribution of these files requirespermission in writing from the publisher.Each file corresponds to one chapter or appendix; the files are in Adobe'sPortable Document Format (PDF).  To display or print these files requiresAdobe Acrobat Reader (or Exchange), version 3.0 or later.Acrobat Reader may be downloaded at no charge from   www.adobe.com/acrobat.IMPORTANT Acrobat font bug:  NEVER OPEN MORE THAN ONE PDF FILE AT ONCE;that is, close each PDF file before opening another.  If more than one PDFfile is open at the same time, characters from mathematics, program, or textfonts may randomly disappear from the display or printed output.The transparency masters in this directory are not intended to take the placeof lecture notes or the textbook.  They are, instead, only one possibleresource for preparing lecture notes.  Almost all the diagrams,specifications, program segments, guidelines, definitions, theorems, and thelike are included in these transparency masters, but very few motivations,derivations, or proofs are included.It is intended neither that a lecture on a section from the textbook shouldinclude all the associated transparencies nor that these transparencies areadequate for preparing such a lecture.  Examples further to those given inthe textbook and alternative treatments presenting a different view of atopic will often enhance the presentation of the subject matter.
